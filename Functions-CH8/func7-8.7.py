#8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. 
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. 
# Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.
# Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
# If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. 
# Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
