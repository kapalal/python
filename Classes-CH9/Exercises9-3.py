#9-3. Users: Make a class called User. 
# Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, 
# and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. 
# Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. 
# Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.
#Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
